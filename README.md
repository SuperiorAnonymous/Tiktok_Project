# TikTok Machine Learning Project

This project applies **Machine Learning algorithms** on a TikTok dataset to explore predictive modeling techniques.  
Two main models were implemented:

- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

Both models were evaluated using **cross-validation** to ensure performance reliability and avoid overfitting.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset was provided as a CSV/Excel file containing TikTok-related features.  
(Data is not shared in this repo due to privacy reasons.)

## ⚙️ Methods
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature engineering
3. Training **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models
4. Model evaluation with cross-validation

## ✅ Results
- Random Forest and XGBoost performances were compared
- Best performing model was selected based on accuracy and cross-validation scores

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📌 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SuperiorAnonymous/Tiktok_Project.git
